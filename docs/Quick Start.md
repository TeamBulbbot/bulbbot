``automod`` - where the bot will post its automod catches
``messagelogs`` - any message log updates (edits, message deletes)
``rolelogs`` - updates happening to the roles
``memberlogs`` - member updates inside of the server (nickname changes, receiving or having a role removed)
``channelogs`` - updates happening to channels
``joinleavelogs`` - users joining or leaving the server
