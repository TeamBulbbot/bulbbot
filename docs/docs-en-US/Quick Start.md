#### Logs
To set up logging for the bot in your server run the following command:  
``!configure <part> <channel>``  

Where the part is:
``mod_action`` - this is the channel where all of the moderation actions will be logged  
``automod`` - where the bot will post its automod catches  
``messagelogs`` - any message log updates (edits, message deletes)  
``rolelogs`` - updates happening to the roles  
``memberlogs`` - member updates inside of the server (nickname changes, receiving or having a role removed)  
``channelogs`` - updates happening to channels  
``joinleavelogs`` - users joining or leaving the server
